Senior Project on MLB

The arbitration process in Major League Baseball is used to prevent holdouts and prolonged disputes. The ability to predict the outcome of the hearing will help the players and teams know where they stand. This could change the amount a player or team submits, so the outcome could turn in their favor. This project used Neural Network and Random Forests models to investigate whether a predictive model is worth using to predict the outcome of arbitration. Results indicated that Neural Network and Random Forests models can be used to predict the outcome of the arbitration process with a low misclassification rate.
